# Pear Lime Jello Salad

### Ingredients:
- 1 package (3 oz) lime-flavored gelatin (Jell-O)
- 1 cup boiling water  
- 1 can (15 oz) pear halves, drained (reserve 1/2 cup pear juice)  
- 1/2 cup cold water  
- 1 cup mini marshmallows  
- 1 cup whipped cream (or whipped topping)  

### Instructions:
1. **Prepare the Gelatin:**  
   Dissolve the lime gelatin in 1 cup of boiling water, stirring until fully dissolved.  

2. **Add Liquids:**  
   Combine the reserved 1/2 cup of pear juice with 1/2 cup of cold water. Stir this into the gelatin mixture to cool it down.  

3. **Blend the Pears:**  
   Mash or blend the pear halves until smooth. You can leave them slightly chunky if you prefer more texture. Mix the pears into the gelatin mixture.  

4. **Cool and Thicken:**  
   Refrigerate the gelatin mixture until it begins to thicken but is not fully set (about 45 minutes to 1 hour).  

5. **Add Marshmallows and Whipped Cream:**  
   Gently fold in the mini marshmallows and whipped cream until evenly distributed.  

6. **Set the Salad:**  
   Pour the mixture into a serving dish, mold, or individual cups. Refrigerate until fully set (about 4-6 hours or overnight).  

7. **Serve:**  
   Serve cold as a side dish or dessert.  

Enjoy this nostalgic dish at your next holiday gathering!
