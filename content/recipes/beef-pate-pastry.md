## Steps

1. Making the Dough - Take your dough from the fridge and, on a clean surface, start pressing it down with your fingers. If you need a few extra drops of oil to prevent sticking to your fingers or countertop, use them. Flatten it as much as you can with this method. From here on you can either use a rolling pin (if yours is large enough) or start stretching it by hand. Remember, you want the dough to be very thin at the end, so thin that you can almost see through it. The dough should be sturdy enough to be pulled thinner and thinner. You can pull it by placing the dough over your hands and stretching it gently, rotating and moving the dough as you go to stretch every part. Try to stretch it into a rectangle. Fold the dough to make layers. The more the layers the more the flaky pastry factor will increase to a point. Have fun and put some muscle into it! Once you are satisfied with your layer density, fold the dough up, place it in a large ceramic bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and place in the fridge.
2. Making the Pâté - Soak the liver ahead of time by placing it in a deep bowl and covering with fresh water and the juice of 1 lemon. Lift each piece of liver to make sure the lemon water gets in between each piece, then set aside in the refrigerator for 8-12 hours. When you're ready to make your pâté, drain the water and proceed with the recipe as normal. Sauté the liver and onions in 2 tablespoons of the butter until the livers are browned and the onions are tender. Add 3/4 cup wine/sherry/port, garlic, mustard, herbs and lemon juice and cook uncovered until most of the liquid has evaporated. Cool slightly, add additional 1/4 cup of wine/sherry/port and blend in a blender or food processor until smooth, along with the remaining butter. Add salt and pepper to taste. If the pâté is dry and crumbly rather than smooth and creamy, add more butter one tablespoon at a time. Place the pâté in a ceramic bowl, grind a generous amount of cracked pepper over the top, and place a fresh lemon wedge on top of the pepper, cover without the plastic wrap touching the pate and let cool. Put in fridge until firm, or cover wrap the plastic-covered bowl entirely with foil and freeze.
3. Making the Pastry - Clean surface, preheat oven to 375 F, working with fresh dough from the fridge, enough for one pastry at a time, and working with fresh pate that is chilled but not frozen, place a very small portion of pâté in a appropriately sized dough for the pastry cutter, press, or decorative method you will use to press and the edge of the dough. Place a small piece of fresh cheddar cheese (now your making the cheeseburger!), fold the dough and press into pastry. Press the edge round, brush with butter, bake at 375 F until golden brown. Remove, store in covered dish, serve as appetizer, enjoy!
